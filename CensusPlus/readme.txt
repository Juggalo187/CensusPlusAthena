Censusplus modified by Skuly for Twinstar:Athena

It's been modified to show both factions instead of just your own, and by right clicking a name from the Playerlist frame you can invite players to guild or add them to your friendlist .
You can use "/census timer #" to set the timer.  # would be how many minutes after your last scan completed to auto start a new scan. 

NOTE: Addons that use LibWho like WIM (WoW Instant Messenger) can break CensusPlus so I would suggest using an alternative if possible, for example instead of WIM I'd use Cellular.
